## Issues and Fixes

1. **Scrolling Behavior on Home Page**
    - **a.** The original home page had a very unconventional and uncomfortable sideways scrolling system.
    - **b.** Ours fixed this issue by having a normal downward scrolling style.
2. **Overwhelming and Confusing Coloration**
    - **a.** The original home page featured far too many colors at once that bombarded the user.
    - **b.** Our home page keeps a more consistent color scheme of greys and reds, except for the initial animation which the user can simply scroll past.
3. **Animation on Home Page**
    - **a.** Most of the initial home page was taken up by a very large, flashy animation that became very annoying after looking at it for long enough.
    - **b.** Our new page shows the animation at the very top, but the page’s actual content lies below it. This makes it to where the user can simply scroll past the animation rather than being forced to stare at it.
4. **Closing the Menu isn’t intuitive**
    - **a.** After opening the navigation menu, the way to make it go away was not obvious. The user had to click the same hamburger menu that made it appear in order to get it to close, which was not clear.
    - **b.** Our navigation bar simply stays at the top of the page, and therefore does not need to be closed in the first place.
5. **Cookie Settings Tab Blocks Content**
    - **a.** There was a “Cookie Settings” tab on the home page that blocked content from the user.
    - **b.** This tab has been replaced with a one-time popup that will ask the user to accept or deny cookies and a link in the footer to bring it back up.
6. **Navigation Menu Blocks Content**
    - **a.** The navigation menu on the “Request Information” page blocked a significant portion of the content.
    - **b.** Our new navigation bar remains at the top, where it will only block content the user scrolls past.
7. **EVENTS Link Unnecessarily Opens a New Tab**
    - **a.** Pressing the ‘EVENTS’ link on the home page used to bring up an entirely different tab. This was unnecessary and annoying for the user, as there wasn’t much reason to go back to the original page.
    - **b.** Now, the events link is located in a dropdown menu in the navigation bar and opens in the same tab.
8. **NEWS Link Opens to a Completely Different Site**
    - **a.** The old ‘NEWS’ link opens to an entirely different site with a different style.
    - **b.** In our website, the news page is consistent with the style of the rest of the pages.
9. **Mobile Viewing Adds Space on the Side**
    - **a.** On the old home page, mobile viewing would align the contents to the left. This created an odd space to the right of the information.
    - **b.** Our website centers content on mobile to look more professional.
10. **Color Inconsistency with Logo**
    - **a.** The old website used a color scheme that did not fit with the simple grey, red, white, and black logo.
    - **b.** Our new color palette consists of colors similar to those found in the logo.
11. **Page Spacing on Bigger Screens**
    - **a.** On certain pages, such as the “degrees” page, a large space would occasionally be placed between the nav bar and content, making the main content of the page completely off-center. This mainly happened on larger screens and was very inconsistent.
    - **b.** Our pages do not have this error and are more professionally laid out.
